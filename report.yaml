how_might_we: How might we create a program to ease people into trusting self-driving cars?

product_narrative: |
So the concept of ollie is crafted around getting people to experience their first ride in a self-driving car by building awareness by providing content, creating a segue to access by offering a free ride, making it an fun experience for the user, but also making the the platform actionable for self-driving car companies to better understand their end consumer by providing data and insights to these companies on the user.
Ollie is not a self driving car, nor AI, but will be in places to help people ease into trusting self driving cars. Ollie's goal is to be the Visa of marketing self-driving cars.
