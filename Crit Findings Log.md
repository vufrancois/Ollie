## Crit 1 Notes:

1. Focus more on why I should care. First couple of slides on benefits weren't really effective.
2. Is education the most effective way or is just letting people try for themselves more effective? Use data to tie this into the narrative.
3. The adoption of self-driving cars is analogous to the adoption elevators.
4. Is an AI humanizing enough to create trust? (Answered via research)

## Crit 2 Notes:
1. Pivot to a marketing strategy.
2. How do we obtain data from autonomous vehicles? Are manufacturers willing to share?
3. How much control does the platform-side have over the API?
4. How do we handle frequently sourcing content from reliable sources? (Hand-picking Initially?)
5. How does content takes precedence on individualized user feeds? (Magic)
6. How do we manage the user feedback loop? (Google Analytics, or Platform captures user activity and provides it back to us)
