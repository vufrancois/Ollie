## Crit 1 Notes:

1. Focus more on why I should care. First couple of slides on benefits weren't really effective.

2. Is education the most effective way or is just letting people try for themselves more effective? Use data to tie this into the narrative.

3. The adoption of self-driving cars is analogous to the adoption elevators.

4. Is an AI humanizing enough to create trust? (Answered via research)
