## Week 1:

Week Behind:

  Met with Company Advisor
  Conducted Research on Self-Driving Cars
  Created 1st Iteration of System Diagram & Wedges of the AV industry
  Created 2 User Stories
  Sent signed CSP Agreement to Company Advisor

Week Ahead:

  Draft and Sign Team Contract
  Create 2 Product Sketches
  Develop an Initial Product Narrative
  Contact Faculty & Studio Advisor, Professor Mor & Hannah Donovan
  Gather Feedback and Iterate System Diagrams and User Stories

Risks/Challenges:

  We have no clear direction yet, but product sketches should help the eliminate the ambiguity


## Week 2:

Week Behind:

  Created & Submitted Internal Team Contract. It can be found here.
  Signed & Submitted Individual CSP-Agreements /w Will.
  We also had our first 2 ideation & product sketching sessions. The results for the first iteration of which can be found here, and the second, here as well.
  We've also begun crafting the first iteration of our product narrative to help steer us in the direction of creating a product that is truly a solution to the problem at hand.
  We've also iterated on the first pass of our system diagram & user stories.

Week Ahead:

  Sprint 1 is at the end of this upcoming. It will give us an opportunity to sit down and start getting our hands dirty. We'll be creating a cohesive and shareable 3 min. presentation to share with all of our stakeholders.
  Prior to the sprint, we plan to start reaching out more to our accessible networks to gain more insight on the industry, user interviews, potential leads/inspiration, or potential pitfalls.
  With more research and knowledge, we plan to iterate on our narrative, user stories, and product sketches.

Risks/Challenges:

  We need to dig deeper and develop a target MVP that we can begin to validate. There are certain ideas and important features that we've found from synthesizing our ideations that may not really be feasible or important to have.
  Because the self-driving car industry is still in the research and development phase, well before mass adoption will be possible, we're working under certain assumptions that could potentially hinder our ideas in terms of testing and usefulness.


## Week 3:

Week Behind:

  We decided on a direction for our product and simplified our narrative.
  We created mockups for an educational game that teaches the player about the self-driving cars. The key is to have a player to build a self-driving car and help the player to understand the technology behind self-driving cars.
  We created a deck based around our narrative and mockups. Please refer to the link for the presentation slides.

Week Ahead:

  We will be going over the feedback we received on the presentation and iterate on our narrative and mockups.
  We will be determining which features of our game we want to pursue.

Risks/Challenges:

  Some of the game mechanics we would like to develop may be technically challenging. We will evaluate rapid development plans.
  There is a risk that we will not be able to do everything we envision. We are ready to scale back on features that prove to be too challenging.


## Week 4:

Week Behind:

  Create & Submitted Architecture Diagram.
  Set team and individual goals for this semester.
  Created GitHub repository, progress board & our weekly progress log.
  Picked key features that would be included to simplify the demo.
  Spoke to Will about our next steps.


Week Ahead:

  Build a demo of the game and test it with at least three users.
  Do our first Crit(critique), collect and analyze feedback.


Risks/Challenges:

  Determine which algorithm we should use to build the demo deck.
  Create the demo within limited time constraints.


## Week 5:

Week Behind:

  Iterated on demo deck and product narrative.
  Received initial feedback from Crit #1.
  Created list of interview questions & survey.
  Interviewed 3 users and received proof of concept validations.
  Created Crit Findings Log and User Findings Log to track progress.
  Updated Weekly Progress Report.


Week Ahead:

  Continue to validate narrative & product idea concepts.
  Create dynamic demo to better validate product idea.
  Determine description, core product loop, and feature set of NCP.
  Update Architecture Diagram.
  Complete Peer Review Surveys.
  Prepare for Sprint #2.


Risks/Challenges:

  Due to timeline constraints, we need to quickly focus in on user validation so we can begin building.
  The development stack for creating a working demo is still up for debate.
  We need to differentiate between customers and users. How will we monetize the app? Does this change its functionality?
