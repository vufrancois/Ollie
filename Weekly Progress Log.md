## Week 1:

Week Behind:

  Met with Company Advisor
  Conducted Research on Self-Driving Cars
  Created 1st Iteration of System Diagram & Wedges of the AV industry
  Created 2 User Stories
  Sent signed CSP Agreement to Company Advisor

Week Ahead:

  Draft and Sign Team Contract
  Create 2 Product Sketches
  Develop an Initial Product Narrative
  Contact Faculty & Studio Advisor, Professor Mor & Hannah Donovan
  Gather Feedback and Iterate System Diagrams and User Stories

Risks/Challenges:

  We have no clear direction yet, but product sketches should help the eliminate the ambiguity


## Week 2:

Week Behind:

  Created & Submitted Internal Team Contract. It can be found here.
  Signed & Submitted Individual CSP-Agreements /w Will.
  We also had our first 2 ideation & product sketching sessions. The results for the first iteration of which can be found here, and the second, here as well.
  We've also begun crafting the first iteration of our product narrative to help steer us in the direction of creating a product that is truly a solution to the problem at hand.
  We've also iterated on the first pass of our system diagram & user stories.

Week Ahead:

  Sprint 1 is at the end of this upcoming. It will give us an opportunity to sit down and start getting our hands dirty. We'll be creating a cohesive and shareable 3 min. presentation to share with all of our stakeholders.
  Prior to the sprint, we plan to start reaching out more to our accessible networks to gain more insight on the industry, user interviews, potential leads/inspiration, or potential pitfalls.
  With more research and knowledge, we plan to iterate on our narrative, user stories, and product sketches.

Risks/Challenges:

  We need to dig deeper and develop a target MVP that we can begin to validate. There are certain ideas and important features that we've found from synthesizing our ideations that may not really be feasible or important to have.
  Because the self-driving car industry is still in the research and development phase, well before mass adoption will be possible, we're working under certain assumptions that could potentially hinder our ideas in terms of testing and usefulness.


## Week 3:

Week Behind:

  We decided on a direction for our product and simplified our narrative.
  We created mockups for an educational game that teaches the player about the self-driving cars. The key is to have a player to build a self-driving car and help the player to understand the technology behind self-driving cars.
  We created a deck based around our narrative and mockups. Please refer to the link for the presentation slides.

Week Ahead:

  We will be going over the feedback we received on the presentation and iterate on our narrative and mockups.
  We will be determining which features of our game we want to pursue.

Risks/Challenges:

  Some of the game mechanics we would like to develop may be technically challenging. We will evaluate rapid development plans.
  There is a risk that we will not be able to do everything we envision. We are ready to scale back on features that prove to be too challenging.


## Week 4:

Week Behind:

  Create & Submitted Architecture Diagram.
  Set team and individual goals for this semester.
  Created GitHub repository, progress board & our weekly progress log.
  Picked key features that would be included to simplify the demo.
  Spoke to Will about our next steps.


Week Ahead:

  Build a demo of the game and test it with at least three users.
  Do our first Crit(critique), collect and analyze feedback.


Risks/Challenges:

  Determine which algorithm we should use to build the demo deck.
  Create the demo within limited time constraints.


## Week 5:

Week Behind:

  Iterated on demo deck and product narrative.
  Received initial feedback from Crit #1.
  Created list of interview questions & survey.
  Interviewed 3 users and received proof of concept validations.
  Created Crit Findings Log and User Findings Log to track progress.
  Updated Weekly Progress Report.


Week Ahead:

  Continue to validate narrative & product idea concepts.
  Create dynamic demo to better validate product idea.
  Determine description, core product loop, and feature set of NCP.
  Update Architecture Diagram.
  Complete Peer Review Surveys.
  Prepare for Sprint #2.


Risks/Challenges:

  Due to timeline constraints, we need to quickly focus in on user validation so we can begin building.
  The development stack for creating a working demo is still up for debate.
  We need to differentiate between customers and users. How will we monetize the app? Does this change its functionality?

## Week 6:

Week Behind:

  Completed second iteration of user interview questions which can be found here.
  Hashed out our product description and feature set of Narrative Complete Product (NCP).
  Created visual representation of product loop
  Reiterated the architecture diagram

Week Ahead:

  Sprint 2! Validate the narrative
  Build working demo of our product loop
  Validate the demo with at least 4 non-students
  Meet with Will to get feedback on the validation presentation

Risks/Challenges:

  We've had a lot of discussions on what the demo should look like and agreed on a set of educational slides or videos, but we haven't laid out the details.
  Sprint 2 is in a few days and we don't quite feel ready


## Week 7:

Week Behind:
  Sprint 2 ​​- Deck
  Recorded +30 User Survey & Interviews
  Pivoted Product Idea
  Updated Architecture Diagram & Product Loop

Week Ahead:
  Unpack Feedback
  Meet /w Will
  Rework Narrative
  More User Validations

Risks/Challenges:

  Would a customer be willing to implement our product into their platform? Who are all our potential customers?
  Does our narrative make sense?
  For demo purposes, is beginning to create a mobile app the best course of action? How do we show our product can be applied in a variety of situations and companies?
  What data points and statistics are important to users?


## Week 8:

Week Behind:

  Unpacked feedback
  Updated Weekly Progress Log
  Got feedback from Karan
  Submitted Peer feedback for the team

Week Ahead:

  Meet /w Will
  Crit
  Ideate and validate on what information to show and how
  Validate (or invalidate) sprint demo with at least more four non-students.
  Update User Findings Log
  Begin a 4min Tech Talk on our system architecture

Risks/Challenges:

  Need to modify narrative to make it clear why a user would interact with our product.


## Week 9:

Week Behind:

  Meeting with Will.
  Crit 2 – validated our idea of building an API product and the approach of exposing users to relevant information to increase trust.
  Pivoted from showing general statistics to presenting more customized content by crowdsourcing.
  Updated architecture diagram and Crit findings log.
  Conceived deck for Tech Talk.

Week Ahead:

 Scrum - give our 4min Tech Talk.
 Embark on developing the system.
 Continue validating our narrative.

Risks/Challenges:

  How do we handle frequently sourcing content from reliable sources?
  How to filter and vet the content posted?
  How to increase user engagement?


## Week 10:

Week behind:
  Scrum 2 - met with other product studio teams and TA and got their insights on our current product
  removing excess features - we had discussions about having a standalone community/forum but decided to drop it as it's not a core feature
  Vu fleshed out the first iteration of the mobile demo design
  Luke and Christy agreed on the tech stack and started building the backbone of a mobile demo in Reactive Native

Week ahead:
  discuss demo design as a group and reiterate
  continue building the mobile app

Risks/Challenges:

  the design and the initial app have some discrepancies that need to be reconciled
  there are many ideas floating around - and that's good - but we need to focus on our decided core features
