User 1: Demographic: Tech-Savvy Cornell Tech Student
1.  I would consider myself very tech savvy.
2.  Public transportation is main form of transportation considering I live in city.
3.  Having the ability to go where I want when I want is very important, so it's very hard not having my car here. I'm at the mercy of the subway.
4.  Yes I do.
5.  I would say first overall cost, reliability, comfortability, and environmental friendliness.
6.  I would say safety and comfort.
7.  I rarely use them, it's more efficient for me living in the city to use the subway.
8.  I would say I'm fairly familiar the technology.
9.  I would say it's at an interesting inflection. There's a lot of fear surrounding the technology because of lack of knowledge and information. People are fearful because of hacking.
10. I would say I'm relatively trustful of it.
11. Of course, without a reliable system of mechanisms which includes the working technology, self-driving cars wouldn't exist. Thus, the ability to trust it or not wouldn't exist.
12. It depends on how much you want to educate them, but no, I don't think so. This situation is analogous to airplanes. We've been flown using autopilot for so long, yet people still fly. I think helping people understand the connection that this isn't as far as a step away from what we currently have is the key to getting them to accept it.
13. Very likely, but I'm also a risk taker.
14. Not very much, I'm excited to utilize the additional space and time to work and focus on things I care about instead of having to drive.
