## Product Description

Ollie is a fun build-yo-SDC game that teaches you about Self-Driving Cars along the way. We want to create an interactive and engaging experience for the user while learning about their preferences. In the game, the user is greeted by a SDC personality called Ollie. The mission is to give Ollie a body by dragging and dropping from a wide selection of auto parts for SDCs. Our hypothesis is that a better understanding of how SDCs work and human-like characteristics help people build trust with real-world autonomous vehicles,  which will revolutionize our lifes in the near future providing safe, low-cost and traffic-free tranportations for all.
